    "Conversational artificial intelligence has evolved significantly since its early origins, when systems were designed primarily for instructional or task-oriented interactions. Early conversational agents such as ELIZA were created to simulate dialogue through simple pattern matching, offering the appearance of conversation without genuine understanding and serving mainly as demonstrations of human–computer interaction rather than functional assistants.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) For decades, most chatbots remained limited to narrow informational tasks, customer service automation, or scripted question answering. In contrast, modern large language models such as ChatGPT have rapidly gained widespread adoption and are now used by millions of people for a diverse range of purposes, extending well beyond information retrieval to include brainstorming, emotional reflection, and relationship-oriented conversations.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This noticeable shift from primarily task-based support toward more social and emotionally expressive interaction motivates the present study, which examines how the distribution of ChatGPT prompt types has changed between April 2023 and May 2024 using topic modeling and sentiment analysis of public conversation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A growing body of research in human–AI interaction has examined the emotional and social dimensions of chatbot use, finding that users often engage conversational agents in ways that resemble interpersonal relationships. For example, Fitzpatrick et al. (2017) studied interactions with a fully automated mental-health chatbot and found that users frequently disclosed personal emotions and reported feeling supported, despite knowing the system was not human.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Similarly, studies of social chatbots such as XiaoIce have shown that users engage in long-term, emotionally expressive conversations and may attribute relational qualities such as empathy and companionship to the system, indicating forms of parasocial or quasi-social interaction.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) More recent work in Proceedings of the ACM on Human–Computer Interaction demonstrates that framing chatbot interactions as ephemeral increases users' willingness to disclose intimate information, reinforcing the idea that conversational agents are often perceived as non-judgmental confidants; however, these findings typically come from specific applications or controlled study settings rather than large-scale, open-ended usage logs.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond small-scale or domain-specific studies, recent research has begun to examine how human–AI interaction evolves using large-scale conversational datasets. For example, research using the WildChat dataset analyzes over one million real-world ChatGPT conversations to characterize how users engage with conversational AI systems across a wide range of intents, demonstrating substantial diversity in prompt types and interaction styles at scale.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) Related large-scale studies of language model usage similarly suggest that as models become more capable and widely deployed, user interactions diversify beyond narrowly task-oriented queries toward more exploratory, creative, and socially oriented uses. However, much of this work focuses on broad usage characterization or safety concerns rather than explicitly examining how the distribution of prompt types changes over time. In addition, some longitudinal analyses aggregate interactions across broad time spans or model versions, limiting their ability to isolate shorter-term temporal shifts in interpersonal versus task-based usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, prior research establishes that conversational agents can elicit emotional disclosure and interpersonal engagement, but it does not directly test whether interpersonal and intrapersonal uses of ChatGPT are becoming more prevalent relative to task-based and informational uses within a recent, well-defined time window. Our project addresses this gap by using the WildChat dataset to examine whether the distribution of ChatGPT prompt types has shifted between April 2023 and May 2024 within a real-world sample of public interactions. By applying topic modeling and sentiment analysis to distinguish task-based prompts from interpersonal and intrapersonal prompts, we extend prior research on emotional disclosure and social uses of chatbots to a large-scale, temporally sensitive setting. This allows us to test whether social and self-reflective uses of ChatGPT are becoming more prevalent over time, rather than simply documenting that such uses exist.\n",

    "We hypothesize that between April 2023 and May 2024, the proportion of interpersonal and intrapersonal ChatGPT prompts will increase relative to task-based and informational prompts. This expectation is based on prior research showing that as conversational AI systems become more capable, familiar, and designed to be pleasant, approachable, and human-like, users increasingly disclose emotions, seek support, and treat them as confidants. Building on evidence that conversational AI use has diversified beyond narrowly task-oriented queries, we expect social and self-reflective interactions with ChatGPT to become more prevalent over time."

    "### WildChat Dataset: Loading, Cleaning, and Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "The WildChat dataset contains over 1 million real-world conversations between users and ChatGPT. For our analysis, we focus on conversations from April 2023 to May 2024 to examine how prompt types have evolved over this 14-month period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key metrics and their meaning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User prompts:** The text input from users to ChatGPT. These are our primary unit of analysis. Prompts can range from single-word queries to multi-paragraph requests. We will analyze these to categorize them as task-based (e.g., \"Write a Python function to sort a list\") versus interpersonal/intrapersonal (e.g., \"I'm feeling anxious about my job interview tomorrow, can you help me process this?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timestamp:** Unix timestamp or datetime indicating when the conversation occurred. This is critical for our temporal analysis, allowing us to track changes month-by-month from April 2023 through May 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Turn count:** Number of back-and-forth exchanges in a conversation. Higher turn counts may indicate more complex or engaging interactions. Multi-turn conversations might suggest deeper engagement, which could be more common in interpersonal exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt length (words):** Word count of user messages. Research suggests task-based prompts tend to be shorter and more directive (\"Translate this to Spanish\"), while interpersonal prompts may be longer and more narrative (\"I've been struggling with my relationship and would like to talk through some thoughts...\"). We calculate this as an approximate word count by splitting on whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt length (characters):** Character count including spaces. This provides an alternative length metric that captures very short responses and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language:** ISO language code (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish). We focus primarily on English ('en') conversations for consistency in NLP analysis, as sentiment analysis and topic modeling tools perform best on English text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset concerns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset presents several challenges that affect our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size and computational constraints:** The dataset is extremely large (several GB), containing over 1 million conversations. To make processing manageable, we work with filtered subsets based on our time period (April 2023 - May 2024) and language (English). Even after filtering, the dataset may contain hundreds of thousands of prompts, requiring efficient data structures and potentially sampling for some analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal data quality:** Not all conversations have clean timestamp data. Some entries may have null or malformed timestamps that need to be excluded. Additionally, the temporal distribution is uneven—some months have significantly more data than others, which could reflect changes in data collection methods, ChatGPT popularity, or user behavior patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Language diversity and code-switching:** While we filter for English conversations, some conversations may contain multiple languages or code-switching (alternating between languages). Technical discussions may include code snippets in programming languages, which we need to handle appropriately in our text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Privacy and content concerns:** The WildChat creators have applied PII (personally identifiable information) redaction, but some personal content may remain. Privacy redaction may affect our ability to analyze certain types of personal or emotional content—ironically, the most interpersonal conversations may have had the most redaction. We also need to be mindful that some conversations may contain sensitive topics that require ethical handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conversation structure variability:** The dataset includes both single-turn conversations (one user prompt, one assistant response) and multi-turn conversations (extended back-and-forth). We need to decide whether to analyze each user prompt independently or consider conversation-level patterns. For our analysis, we treat each user prompt as an independent observation while also tracking which conversation it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ground truth absence:** We have no verified labels for what constitutes \"task-based\" versus \"interpersonal/intrapersonal\" prompts. We will need to develop and validate our categorization approach through topic modeling and potentially manual review of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Selection bias:** Users who share their conversations publicly may differ systematically from those who don't. People sharing emotional or personal conversations might be more open about mental health, while those with sensitive work queries might not share at all. This could affect our ability to detect genuine temporal trends versus shifts in who is sharing data."

    "As a team, we recognize that data analysis is not neutral. Even descriptive analytics can influence decisions, shape narratives, and create downstream consequences. Because of this, we approach our work with careful attention to ethical responsibility, fairness, and unintended impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will ensure that all data used in this project is legally obtained and ethically appropriate for academic analysis. If working with conversation data such as ChatGPT interactions, we acknowledge the heightened sensitivity of such information. Even if data is anonymized, conversational data may contain personal, emotional, or behavioral signals that could be misused. We will avoid exposing identifying details, refrain from attempting re-identification, and treat conversational data with additional care due to its inherently personal nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we explicitly consider unintended uses of our findings. Analytical results can be repurposed beyond their original intent. For example, insights derived from conversational data could potentially be used for surveillance, profiling, behavioral manipulation, or targeted persuasion. Even aggregate patterns may enable systems that categorize or predict user behavior in ways that limit autonomy. We will clearly state the scope of our analysis and discourage interpretations that extend beyond the evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we are attentive to fairness across groups. Data often reflects existing social inequalities, historical bias, and uneven representation. Even descriptive statistics can reinforce stereotypes if presented without context. We will examine whether certain groups are underrepresented, overrepresented, or systematically portrayed differently in the dataset. Where disparities appear, we will avoid causal claims without evidence and will acknowledge structural explanations rather than attributing differences to inherent characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we recognize that descriptive analytics can still contribute to downstream bias mitigation or harm. For instance, identifying patterns may influence future model training, policy decisions, or product design choices. If our results highlight disparities, those findings could be used either to improve fairness or to justify exclusionary practices. Because of this, we will frame conclusions carefully, document limitations, and avoid deterministic interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we commit to transparency and academic integrity. All preprocessing steps, assumptions, and limitations will be clearly documented. External tools, including AI systems, will be used in accordance with course guidelines and properly acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is not simply to generate accurate results, but to ensure that the knowledge produced is responsible, context-aware, and mindful of its broader social impact."
